      <p>Hello, I'm Chef Bonne Nourriture (my secret identity is actually Batman.)</p>
      <p>This blog has been featured on the 12-time Ellie Award winning GOOD FOOD magazine many times, <br>
      and the blog itself has won 5 Savuer Blog of the Year Awards.</p>
      <p>And if you're wondering, yes indeed I am the chef that made the cake at the Royals' wedding.</p>
      <p>Because I'm Batman.</p>
      <p>Have fun reading and enjoy the recipes!</p>
      <h2>About me</h2>
      <img src = "batman.jpg" height= "50%" width= "30%">
      <p>As I might've mentioned before, my secret identity is Batman. </p>
      <p>But as Batman, I was obliged to sit in my Bat Cave all day and eat Lobster Thermador to add mystery to my character.</p>
      <p>No one knew how much I yearned for Lobster Bisque or Lobster Mac and Cheese or even a good old Lobster Roll.</p>
      <p>So I set off into the world and created another secret identity for myself and discovered that there was good food that didn't involve Lobster.</p>
      <p>And became a world renowned chef along the way.</p>
      <p>Because I'm Batman.</p>
      <br>

      <p>These breakfast foods are my secret to looking super Batmansy.</p>
      <p>The Hash Browns are my personal favorite, deep fried and dusted with pepper jack and mozzarella, <br>
        drizzled with spicy dipping sauce and caramelized onions buried inside.</p>
      <p>The Avocado Toast has avocado spread, queso fresco, pickled onions, sriracha aioli, and soft poached eggs <br>
        all smothered over pan-toasted bread.</p>
      <p>The Dutch Pancakes, topped with fresh berries and whipped cream, and the Cinnamon Rolls, with a dollop of <br>
        brown butter frosting serve as the perfect sugar rush so I can get on with a day of saving Gotham City from various evildoers.</p>
